# Hi, I'm Jimin 👋
**AI Engineer** exploring the intersection of **Healthcare, Law, and Biology**.
I build *traceable* agentic workflows, not just chatboxes.

Previously a Web Developer, now orchestrating Multi-Agent Systems to solve domain-specific problems.

## 🚀 Why I Build
I specialize in converting unstructured "messy" data (Medical guidelines, Legal codes, Protein structures) into **computable & searchable knowledge graphs**.
* **Current Focus:** GraphRAG, Multi-Agent Orchestration (LangGraph), Evaluation Pipelines.
* **Next Move:** Optimizing AI infrastructure with **Rust** & Deep diving into **Bio-informatics** (Protein Folding).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python, PyTorch, FastAPI
* **Agent & Search:** LangChain/LangGraph, Neo4j, Qdrant, OpenSearch
* **Learning:** Rust (for high-performance serving), Flow Matching

## ⚡ Featured Projects

### **🏥 MedClaim (iHopper)**
**AI-Powered Medical Insurance Review Agent**
> [Live Service](https://medclaim.ihopper.co.kr/main) | [Featured in MedicalTimes](https://www.medicaltimes.com/Main/News/NewsView.html?ID=1165282) | [DBR Case Study](https://dbr.donga.com/kfocus/view/article_no/616)

A commercial RAG solution addressing the complexity of Korean medical insurance standards.
* **The Challenge:** Automating reviews based on constantly changing government notices (고시) and complex calculation rules.
* **My Role:** Engineered the **Domain-Specific RAG Pipeline** handling messy regulation updates.
* **Key Tech:**
    * **Traceability:** Answers include direct citations (source/clause) and calculation logic.
    * **Hybrid Search:** Orchestrated **OpenSearch** (Keyword) + **Qdrant** (Vector) for precise retrieval.
    * **Impact:** Presented at **KHF 2025**; Successfully deployed for field usage.

### **🧬 Protein Structure & Drug Discovery (Research Interest)**
* Exploring **Flow Matching with Transformers** to optimize protein folding models (beyond AlphaFold3).
* Goal: High-throughput screening for drug discovery.

## 🎯 Why Hackathon? 
I want to push the boundaries of **Claude Code**. I aim to build **self-maintaining subagents** that can autonomously track domain knowledge changes (like new laws or research papers) and update their own testing pipelines—automating the "ResearchOps" workflow.
