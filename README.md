# Hi, I'm Jimin 👋
**AI Engineer** exploring the intersection of **Healthcare, Law, and Biology**.
I build *traceable* agentic workflows, not just chatboxes.

Previously a Web Developer, now orchestrating Multi-Agent Systems to solve domain-specific problems.

## 🚀 Why I Build
I specialize in converting unstructured "messy" data (Medical guidelines, Legal codes, Protein structures) into **computable & searchable knowledge graphs**.
* **Current Focus:** GraphRAG, Multi-Agent Orchestration (LangGraph), Evaluation Pipelines.
* **Next Move:** Optimizing AI infrastructure with **Rust** & Deep diving into **Bio-informatics** (Protein Folding).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python, PyTorch, FastAPI
* **Agent & Search:** LangChain/LangGraph, Neo4j, Qdrant, OpenSearch
* **Learning:** Rust (for high-performance serving), Flow Matching

## ⚡ Featured Projects

### **💊 Medical Insurance AI Agent (Production)**
* **Problem:** Complex insurance review processes with scattered regulations.
* **Solution:** Built a RAG system integrating **FastAPI** & **Vector Search** to provide evidence-based answers with citation.
* **Impact:** Presented at **KHF 2025**. Reduced review time by automating regulation cross-checking.

### **🧬 Protein Structure & Drug Discovery (Research Interest)**
* Exploring **Flow Matching with Transformers** to optimize protein folding models (beyond AlphaFold3).
* Goal: High-throughput screening for drug discovery.

## 🎯 Hackathon Goal
I want to push the boundaries of **Claude Code**.
Instead of simple coding assistance, I aim to build **self-correcting subagents** that handle the "boring but complex" parts of domain research and deployment.
